Home Task #1

These tasks will help you to practice skills of working with Variables & Data Types, Conditions and Functions. You can use this Lesson draft as helper: lesson draft. Do tasks in 2 styles: ES5 (current JS version - var) and ES6 (new JS version - let / const).

Your scripts for home task should be published as Gist on Github and sent to me.

Variables

Create next list of variables:

name -- your name as String
age -- your age as Number
hasDriverLicense -- do you have driver license as Bool
grades -- list of your grades for last 5 exams as Array
person -- Object of your personality with all variables listed above
After, print name, age and grades with console.log. Also, print your 2nd grade from grades array and person's Object age property.

Conditions

You need to create 2 number variables with random values. Then check, if first variable is bigger (tip: num1 > num2), print 'Number one is bigger', otherwise print 'Number two is bigger';

Functions

Create function which calculates sum of 3 arguments passed to it.

//ES 5:

var name = 'Alexander';
var age = 30
var hasDriverLicense = true;
var grades = [3, 5, 4, 2, 4];
var person = {
  name : 'Alexander',
  age : 30,
  hasDriverLicense : true,
  grades : [3, 5, 4, 2, 4]
};
    
document.write(grades[1] + '<br>');
document.write(person.name);
After, print name, age and grades with console.log. Also, print your 2nd grade from grades array and person's Object age property.
